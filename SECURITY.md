# Security Audits and Analyses

We greatly welcome security audits and analysis of our projects.

We are happy to work with you in assessing potential issues and in
developing effective secure solutions.

Should you find anything of concern, please feel free to email us at
[security@mobilecoin.com](mailto:security@mobilecoin.com). We
appreciate responsible disclosure and are happy to collaborate on
timed announcements to credit you for your research discovery.

## Out of Scope

Anything in `/vendor` is out-of-scope from our perspective, although
we are happy to help coodinate talking to the respective parties in
control of upstream maintenance of works and/or libraries which we
depend upon.

Also out-of-scope is hardware security issues with particular devices.
For example, should a certain chipset utilised by a vendor be subject
to timing attacks, fault injection attacks, etc., this is not within
scope.
